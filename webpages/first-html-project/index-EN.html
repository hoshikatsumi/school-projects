      These sentences are useful when evaluating pure design rather than content. This is because it is said that once people read a text and understand its meaning, it affects their evaluation of other parts.

      Then what about Japanese? Unlike the Latin script, the Japanese writing system is very complex. Since it is written by interweaving hiragana, katakana, kanji, numbers, and alphabets, it cannot be substituted at all.
      <br> <br>
      However, these do not contain kanji, hiragana, katakana, and alphanumeric characters, and the quality of dummy sentences is not very high.
